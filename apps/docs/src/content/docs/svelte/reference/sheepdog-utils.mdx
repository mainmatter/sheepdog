title: Sheepdog Utils
description: the utilities object that is available in every task
---

When creating a task (of any type) there are 2 possible arguments that can be accessed, the first is any argument that is passed in when calling `.perform()`, and the second is an object that can be used to optionally enhance your task - `SheepdogUtils`.

`SheepdogUtils` offers two properties to extend your task with:
- `signal` - the `AbortSignal` is available so that you can do any further manipulation you need based on the state of the `AbortSignal`. We won't go into too much detail about this as it is the standard `AbortSignal` interface that is simply passed back from `Sheepdog`.
- `link` - this is a `Sheepdog` specific function that allows you to bind tasks together. For more information, check out the [Linking Tasks explainer](/explainer/linking-tasks).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async (myArgument, {signal, link}) => {
		// your code
	});
</script>
```

```ts
type SheepdogUtils = {
	signal: AbortSignal;
	link: <TArgs, TReturn>(task: Task<TArgs, TReturn>) => Task<TArgs, TReturn>;
};
```
