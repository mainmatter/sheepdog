This explainer is meant to show you how the `Async Transform` Vite plugin works so that you can be
confident in using it. If you want to know how to setup the Vite plugin please go to the following

## What is a Vite plugin?

If you just want to know about what the `Async Transform` does, feel free to skip to the next
paragraph. If you're completely new to Vite plugins or just want to understand more about what they
are; here's a brief introduction.

<details>
	<summary>Introduction to Vite plugins</summary>

    A Vite plugin is essentially a small bit of code with a series of methods that Vite will call
    sequentially during the dev and build script.

    Every function is called at a specific moment of the build and can affect it in different ways.

    Here's an example of a simple Vite plugin that is very similar to one in <BlankLink href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin" body="their documentation" />

    <Code lang="ts" code={`

export const simpleTransform = {
	// name is used during debug
	name: 'simple-transform',
	transform(src, fileName){
		// we only handle our custom file extension
		if(fileName.endsWith('.myext')){
			return {
				// we transform the text in our file
				// to JS
				code: myExtToJs(src),
				// if possible, return a sourcemap to allow for better debugging
				map: null,
			}
		}
	}
};
`}/>

In this case we handle our own custom file extension and compile that to JS but you can also use the
transform hook to change your JS.

    <Code lang="ts" code={`

export const simpleTransform = {
	// name is used during debug
	name: 'remove-console-logs',
	transform(src){
		return {
			code: src.replaceAll(/console.log\(.+?\)/g, ""),
			map: null,
		}
	}
};
`}/>

This super simple plugin eliminates every instance of `console.log()` from your code.

<Aside type="caution">
	Don't use this anywhere. It's just a silly example and you should probably be a bit more nuanced
	than `replaceAll` if you want to remove logs from your code.
</Aside>

The gist of it is: you can do a lot of cool things with a Vite plugin and we decided to build the
Async Transform to make your life (hopefully) easier!

## How does the `Async Transform` change my code?

The reason we are writing this explainer is because we firmly believe that if you allow your code to
be changed by some script you should fully understand how it changes it and what the final result
will look like.

As shown in our [Mid run cancellation](/explainers/mid-run-cancellation) explainer, this Vite plugin
aims to solve a couple of problems with async code in Typescript:

- Promises are not cancelable: once you start them there's no way to stop the code in the middle of
  the function from executing.
- Generators can be "stopped" mid execution but Typescript doesn't play very well with the `yield`
  keyword.

To fix these problems, we let you write the simple and more familiar async code, and we provide a
Vite plugin to transform your async functions into generators!

<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async () => {
		const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');

	});
</script>

<button
	on:click={() => {
		myTask.perform();
	}}

	const myTask = task(async function* () {
		const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return yield result.json();
	});

<button

	perform

```

As you can see we aim to touch your code the bare minimum. But I can still see the worry on your
face, so let's dive a bit more and make a couple of clarifications

### What about my other async functions?

If you don't want to see all of your beloved async functions be turned into generators, worry not,
because we specifically target only the async functions that are arguments of our own `task` or
`task.modifier` functions. And we were really careful with this so even if you have other functions
that are named `task` or if you rename your import everything outside the argument of that function
will be left untouched.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Before">

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task as sheepdogTask } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	function task(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
		// your code
	}

	// this will remain untouched
	const otherTask = task(async () => {
		// some async stuff
	});

	// this will be transformed
	const myTask = sheepdogTask(async () => {
		const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return await result.json();
	});
</script>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After">

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task as sheepdogTask } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	function task(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
		// your code
	}

	// this will remain untouched
	const otherTask = task(async () => {
		// some async stuff
	});

	// this will be transformed
	const myTask = sheepdogTask(async function* () {
		const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return yield result.json();
	});
</script>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

and the same works even for imported functions with the same name.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task as sheepdogTask } from '@sheepdog/svelte';
	import { task } from 'random-npm-library';

	// this will remain untouched
	const otherTask = task(async () => {
		// some async stuff
	});

	// this will be transformed
	const myTask = sheepdogTask(async () => {
		const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return await result.json();
	});
</script>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After">

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task as sheepdogTask } from '@sheepdog/svelte';
	import { task } from 'random-npm-library';

	// this will remain untouched
	const otherTask = task(async () => {
		// some async stuff
	});

	// this will be transformed
	const myTask = sheepdogTask(async function* () {
		const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return yield result.json();
	});
</script>
```

</TabItem>

However sometimes you might want to have a single function to create multiple tasks or maybe you
want to have your tasks in a separate ts file. Well good news for you...

## The `transform` function

If you want to tell `@sheepdog/svelte` that a function is meant to be transformed because you will
pass that function to a task you can do so by using the `transform` function exported from
`@sheepdog/svelte/utils`.

This function doesn't do anything at runtime but it serves to purpose:

1. As a marker for the vite plugin to transform the function you pass to it.
2. as a "safety measure". The function will actually throw in `DEV` if you use it without the Async
   Transform. This will warn you that what you expect to be a mid-run-cancellable function it is not
   because you forgot to add the vite plugin.

Here's how a transformed function will look like

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Before">

```ts
import { transform } from '@sheepdog/svelte/utils';

// this will be converted
const myTask = transform(async () => {
	const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
	return await result.json();
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After">

```ts
// this will be converted
const myTask = async function* () {
	const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
	return yield result.json();
};
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

as you can see the function invocation was completely removed. This obviously works the same if you
rename your import.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Before">

```ts
import { transform as sheepdogTransform } from '@sheepdog/svelte/utils';
import { transform } from 'random-npm-library';

// this will remain untouched
const otherTransform = transform(async () => {
	// async stuff
});

// this will be converted
const myTask = sheepdogTransform(async () => {
	const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
	return await result.json();
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After">

```ts
import { transform } from 'random-npm-library';

// this will remain untouched
const otherTransform = transform(async () => {
	// async stuff
});

// this will be converted
const myTask = async function* () {
	const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
	return yield result.json();
};
```

</TabItem>
