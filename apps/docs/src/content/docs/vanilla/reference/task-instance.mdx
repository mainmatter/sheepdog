title: Task Instance
description: the underlying structure of every task instance

### Structure

To standardize the approach regardless of which task modifier you're using, every task modifier will
use the same underlying `TaskInstance` structure inside of a svelte store.

A `TaskInstance` comprises of:

- `error`: if an error is thrown inside the task instance, it will be found here
- `value`: if the task instance completed successfully, this will be the return value
- `on`: a function to add a listener on the task instance itself, the events you can listen for are:
  - `error`: emitted by the instance when an error is thrown during the run
  - `finish`: emitted by the instance when for whatever reason it finishes (either if it errors, is
    being canceled or it complete successfully)
  - `cancel`: emitted by the instance when the task is canceled
  - `start`: emitted by the instance when the task actually starts (it could be canceled before this
    event is emitted)
  - `success`: emitted by the instance when the execution terminates without erroring out or being
    canceled

And for those of you that prefer to read code, here is the typing of the `TaskInstance`:

```ts
type TaskInstance<TReturn> = {
	/**
	 * If an error is thrown inside the task instance, it will be found here.
	 */
	error?: Error;

	/**
	 * If the task instance completed successfully, this will be the return value.
	 */
	value?: TReturn;

	/**
	 * A function to add a listener on the task instance itself, the events you can listen for are:
	 *
	 * - error
	 * - finish
	 * - cancel
	 * - start
	 * - success
	 */
	on: (event: InstanceEvents, cb: () => void, options?: AddEventListenerOptions) => void;
};
```

where `InstanceEvents` is:

```ts
type InstanceEvents = 'error' | 'finish' | 'cancel' | 'start' | 'success';
```

### Cancellation

Each task instance is also packaged with a `cancel` function that can be used to cancel itself.

```ts
import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

const myTask = task(async () => {
	// your code
});

let lastInstance;

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance = myTask.perform();
});

cancelLast.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance?.cancel();
});
```
