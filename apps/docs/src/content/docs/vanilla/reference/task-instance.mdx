description: the underlying structure of every task instance

### Structure

To standardize the approach regardless of which task modifier you're using, every task modifier will use the same underlying `TaskInstance` structure inside of a svelte store.

A `TaskInstance` comprises of:
- `error`: if an error is thrown inside the task instance, it will be found here
- `hasStarted`: it is possible for the task instance to be in a queue, waiting to start. This property will change to `true` the instant the task instance has started
- `isCanceled`: whether the task instance was canceled
- `isError`: whether the task instance throw an error before completing
- `isRunning`: whether the task instance is currently running
- `isSuccessful`: whether the task instance completed successfully
- `value`: if the task instance completed successfully, this will be the return value

And for those of you that prefer to read code, here is the typing of the `TaskInstance`:
```ts
type TaskInstance<TReturn> = {
	/**
	 * If an error is thrown inside the task instance, it will be found here.
	 */
	error?: Error;

  /**
   * Indicates whether the task instance has started.
   */
  hasStarted: boolean;

	/**
	 * Indicates whether the task instance was canceled.
	 */
	isCanceled: boolean;

	/**
	 * Indicates whether the task instance threw an error before completing.
	 */
	isError: boolean;

	/**
	 * Indicates whether the task instance is currently running.
	 */
	isRunning: boolean;

	/**
	 * Indicates whether the task instance completed successfully.
	 */
	isSuccessful: boolean;

	/**
	 * If the task instance completed successfully, this will be the return value.
	 */
	value?: TReturn;
};
```

You can access these properties just as you would with any other Svelte store:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async () => {
		// your code
	});

  let lastInstance;
</script>

<button on:click={() => {
  lastInstance = myTask.perform()
  }}> Press me </button>

  {#if $lastInstance.isRunning}
    Last instance is running!
  {/if}

<button on:click={() => {
  const myInstance = myTask.perform()
  myInstance.get() // { isRunning: true, hasStarted: true, ... }
  }}> Press me </button>
```

### Cancellation

Each task instance is also packaged with a `cancel` function that can be used to cancel itself.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async () => {
		// your code
	});

  let lastInstance;
</script>

<button on:click={() => {
  lastInstance = myTask.perform()
  }}> Press me </button>

<button on:click={() => {
  lastInstance?.cancel()
  }}> Cancel </button>
```
