import { Tabs, TabItem, Code, Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import BlankLink from '@components/BlankLink.astro';

The simplest way to use `@sheepdog/svelte` is the following

```svelte
<script>
	import { task, timeout } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async () => {
		// async stuff
	});
</script>

<button
	on:click={() => {
		myTask.perform();
	}}
>
	do async stuff
</button>
```

This will run your async function when the user presses the button. _"But why not use a normal async
function?"_ I hear you ask.

**Because the `myTask` variable that you used to call `perform` is also a svelte store that contains
a lot of useful information about your task!**

## `Task` structure

- `isRunning`: whether the task is currently running or not
- `last`: the last task instance, regardless of whether it errored, was canceled, or was successful
- `lastCanceled`: the last canceled task instance
- `lastErrored`: the last errored task instance
- `lastRunning`: the last running task instance, as soon as the task stops running, this will be
  undefined
- `lastSuccessful`: the last successful task instance
- `performCount`: the number of times the task has been run,

```ts
type Task = {
	/**
	 * whether the task is currently running or not
	 */
	isRunning: boolean;
	/**
	 * the last task instance, regardless of whether it errored, was canceled, or was successful
	 */
	last?: TaskInstance;
	/**
	 * the last canceled task instance
	 */
	lastCanceled?: TaskInstance;
	/**
	 * the last errored task instance
	 */
	lastErrored?: TaskInstance;
	/**
	 * the last running task instance, as soon as the task stops running, this will be undefined
	 */
	lastRunning?: TaskInstance;
	/**
	 * the last successful task instance
	 */
	lastSuccessful?: TaskInstance;
	/**
	 * number of times the task has been run,
	 */
	performCount: number;
};
```

## `TaskInstance` structure

To make it easier to reason about, every type of task modifier utilizes the same underlying structure. You can find more detail about the structure of the `TaskInstance` in the [reference docs](/reference/task-instance).

## Task modifiers

`@sheepdog/svelte` allows you to specify a task modifier that changes the behavior of the perform
function. By default when you call `perform` the task will be executed immediately regardless if
there are other instances of the same task in execution. For example, you could use the `enqueue`
modifier to instruct `@sheepdog/svelte` to execute the task instances one after another (in a
queue - who would've thought)

Here's how you can specify the modifier:

<Tabs syncKey="examples">
	<TabItem label="Dot notation">
	```svelte ins=".enqueue" {4}
	<script>
		import { task, timeout } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

    	const myTask = task.enqueue(async () => {
    		// async stuff
    	});
    </script>

    <button on:click={()=>{
    	myTask.perform();
    }}>
    	do async stuff one by one
    </button>
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Option notation">
    ```svelte ins="enqueue" {6}
    <script>
    	import { task, timeout } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

    	const myTask = task(async () => {
    		// async stuff
    	}, { kind: "enqueue" });
    </script>

    <button on:click={()=>{
    	myTask.perform();
    }}>
    	do async stuff one by one
    </button>
    ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

There are currently five task modifiers that you can apply to your task.

- `default`: the default behavior, every task will run immediately
- `drop`: if other tasks are already running the new instance will be immediately canceled
- `enqueue`: every task instance is stored in a queue and executed with a
  <BlankLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)" body="FIFO" />
  strategy
- `keepLatest`: like drop but the last instance will actually be kept around and executed as soon as
  the current running instance finishes
- `restart`: the oldest running task instance is canceled and the new one will start running
  immediately
