import Mainmatter from '@assets/Mainmatter.astro';

`@sheepdog/vanilla` is a library that aims to solve a problem that every developer will face at one
point or another: handling async and concurrent tasks.

`@sheepdog/vanilla` supplies a simple way to introduce cancellable concurrency into your app. Not
only do we provide the "cancelability" that is missing from normal Promises, `@sheepdog/vanilla`
also provides a public API that allows you to observe the running state of your task without having
to set a single flag manually.

Tasks that live on components are automatically canceled when their context is destroyed, meaning
you don't need to worry about the clean up - we've got you covered.

Choose whether you want to keep the oldest, keep the newest or keep all instances of your task to
help boost the performance of your app and reduce unnecessary server load.
