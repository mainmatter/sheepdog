As we hinted in the [What is it?](/vanilla/getting-started/what-is-it/) explainer, one of the
advantages of `@sheepdog/vanilla` is that it allows you to really "cancel" a task. Let's look at the
actual problem and how it is solved with `@sheepdog/vanilla`.

## The problem

Promises are the de facto way to run asynchronous code in JavaScript and (especially after the
introduction of the `async` and `await` keywords) they are quite nice to work with.

```ts
// this automatically returns a promise
async function myStuff() {
	//i can await for the execution of async code to happen
	const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
	const myEndpoint = await response.json();

	return myEndpoint.data;
}
```

However, they have a big problem: Once invoked there is no way to stop the execution of the code.
This can lead to performance problems in the simplest case or even bugs in more complex scenarios.

```ts
async function fetchALotOfStuff() {
	const response = await fetch('/api/very-long-list');
	const longList = await response.json();

	// what if the user canceled the request before this step?
	for (const element of longList) {
		expensiveCalculation(element);
	}
}
```

This can be hard to wrap your head around especially if you directly manipulate the dom after the
fetch call.

```ts
function fetchList() {
	const response = await fetch('/api/very-long-list');
	const list = await response.json();

	for (let element of list) {
		document.getElementById('my-list').appendChild(element);
	}
}

button.addEventListener('click', fetchList);
```

The simplest way to solve this problem is to set up a variable and check it after the fetch.

```ts
let canceled = false;

function fetchList() {
	canceled = false;
	const response = await fetch('/api/very-long-list');
	const list = await response.json();
	if (canceled) return;
	for (let element of list) {
		document.getElementById('my-list').appendChild(element);
	}
}

button.addEventListener('click', fetchList);
cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	canceled = true;
});
```

This works fine but it gets tedious pretty fast, especially if you need to do it multiple times.
That's where `@sheepdog/vanilla` comes into play.

## The solution(s)

`@sheepdog/vanilla` provides you multiple tools to solve this problem (hence the parenthesized
plural in the title of this section); let's go over them one by one

<LinkCard
	href="/vanilla/reference/default"
	title="Task"
	description="If you need more info on the task function please visit the relevant reference page"
/>

### Solution 1: `AbortSignal`

The simplest but more verbose solution to this problem is to use `AbortSignal` solution:
`@sheepdog/vanilla` invokes your task with a series of utils, one of which is the `AbortSignal`.
Every task has its own `AbortController` and you can cancel a single task instance by invoking the
`cancel` method on it or cancel **every** instance by invoking the `cancelAll` method on the task.

```ts
import { task } from '@sheepdog/vanilla';

let list;
let lastInstance;

const fetchTask = task((_, { signal }) => {
	// we can pass the signal to fetch to potentially abort the in-flight request
	const response = await fetch('/api/very-long-list', { signal });
	const list = await response.json();
	for (let element of list) {
		document.getElementById('my-list').appendChild(element);
	}
});

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance = fetchTask.perform();
});
cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance.cancel();
});

cancelAllButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	fetchTask.cancelAll();
});
```

We've gained the ability to stop in-flight fetches with the `AbortSignal` without having to create a
separate `canceled` variable. That's a win, but it does not cover other async functions or library
APIs that do not support `AbortSignals`.

### Solution 2: Async generators

Those who don't know about <BlankLink
	href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_generators"
	body="generators"
/> might be a bit confused right now and those who know about them might be already running away in
fear, but please bear with us for a second and we will show you that generators are not really that
scary.

A generator is a particular function in JavaScript that is able to `yield` back the execution to the
caller. The syntax to create one looks like this:

```ts
function* ping() {
	console.log('in the generator');
	const value = yield 'pong';
	console.log(`after yield: ${value}`);
}

const generator = ping();
const yielded = generator.next();
// logs: "in the generator"
console.log(yielded);
// logs: { done: false, value: "pong" }
generator.next('ping');
// logs: "after yield: ping"
```

I know, I told you this wouldn't be scary and for the moment I haven't kept my promise (pun
intended). But the main takeaway from this snippet of code is that generator functions have a way to
stop executing and return something to the caller and the caller has a way to communicate something
back.

`@sheepdog/vanilla` has been built to be able to accept an async generator function and, most
importantly, has been built to make the generator function work basically like a normal async
function if you replace `await` with `yield`. Let's take a look

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Generator">

```ts
let value;
const myTask = task(async function* (_, { signal }) {
	const response = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint', { signal });
	value = yield response.json();
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Async">

```ts
let value;
const myTask = task(async (_, { signal }) => {
	const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint', { signal });
	value = await response.json();
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

As you can see, the code in the two tabs changes very little but with generators `@sheepdog/vanilla`
has the ability to never call `next` if the task was canceled. This means that if you cancel the
task while fetch is still in-flight the second line of the function will **never** be called!

There is one small detail we have hidden from you, however: `yield` doesn't work very well with
TypeScript, especially if there are multiple of them. If you try to paste that code in a `.ts` file,
you will see all sorts of errors. This is because TypeScript doesn't know which kind of data
`@sheepdog/vanilla` will pass back to the generator.

To fix this problem, you can use `yield` as a sort of `if+return`

```ts
let value;
const myTask = task(async function* (_, { signal }) {
	// use normal await here to get proper typing
	const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint', { signal });
	// yield after every await to allow `@sheepdog/vanilla` to cancel the function
	yield;
	// pay attention to never assign directly to an await if you want to still have proper cancellation
	const tempValue = await response.json();
	yield;
	value = tempValue;
});
```

Can we do better than this? Yes we can!

### Solution 3: Async Transform

`@sheepdog/vanilla` really cares about your DX and that's why we have built a Vite plugin that you
can use to get the best of both worlds: The dynamic cancellation of generators and the expressivity
and simplicity of async functions.

<Aside type="tip">
	You can read about how to set up the Async Transform in our [installation
	guide](/vanilla/getting-started/installation/#setup-the-async-transform) or read more about how it
	works in our [Async Transform guide](/vanilla/explainers/async-transform)
</Aside>

In short, what the Vite plugin does, is transform every async function inside a `task` to an async
generator and it substitutes every `await` with a `yield`. This fixes all our problems because the
TypeScript language server will resolve the types based on your actual code while at runtime
`@sheepdog/vanilla` will be able to cancel every task, even in the middle of an execution!

```ts
import { task } from '@sheepdog/vanilla';

let list;

const fetchTask = task((_, { signal }) => {
	const response = await fetch('/api/very-long-list', { signal });
	// this line will never be executed if the task is canceled before fetch ends
	const list = await response.json();
	for (let element of list) {
		document.getElementById('my-list').appendChild(element);
	}
});

let lastInstance;

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance = fetchTask.perform();
});
cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	lastInstance.cancel();
});

cancelAllButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	fetchTask.cancelAll();
});
```
